This is a read me file. In this file there will be a brief description of the project.

The project aims to develop a card rogue-like rpg type of game taking inspiration from games like Legends of Runeterra and Slay the Spire. That's a simple, personal project that I made to learn how to do a game that I would enjoy playing.

So far the backbone of the project is being build, that is, the core mechanics of the game, such as: Card object, draw cards from deck, turn system, cards interactions, player and opponent health.
